 * The day read as a list rather than as a grid.
 *
 * A column per court needs horizontal room a phone does not have — the grid
 * asks for 680px before it can be read at all, which is a sideways scroll on
 * every device the desk actually carries. The same day is offered here court by
 * court, in the order the day runs.
 *
 * The geometry is dropped on the way in: a list has no percentages, only
 * sequence. What it gains instead is wording. The grid could lean on colour
 * because its legend sat directly underneath, and a list scrolls away from any
 * legend, so each entry says what it is.
